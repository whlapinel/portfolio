## 1/3/2025

Big progress today. I'm now able to delete the courses directory and re-generate it from the app's database and file system. It's pretty fragile though, and there are some things that need to be fixed ASAP:

- Slides are tied directly with a lesson id, so the next semesters lessons won't inherit those slides. Big problem!
  - I'll need to figure out how to do this -- I think I will just do the same as what I've done with images and files, but I'm not sure if this is optimal or not.
- docs root folder is not generated, so js, styles etc. must be manipulated manually. only courses folder and below is generated. Need to make deleting this directory part of the generation code.
- Courses main page image is not an attribute of term, but should be (very minor issue)
