- Had to write this down somewhere for now... currently my echo server is getting slides as a string from the marp server. But maybe I should instead just proxy my marp server with Caddy and put an iframe with the reverse proxy link to the slides? One big issue here is that the js in marp slides assumes the client is local host and it's trying to establish a websocket connection for live reload or something. So maybe I do need to filter that out with my app.
