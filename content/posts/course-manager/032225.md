- Built a very smooth development and deployment setup this week with Docker compose including nice `task` shortcuts.
- Decided yesterday that I eventually want to make the following changes:
  - Use Kubernetes instead of Docker compose for production (probably overkill, but would facilitate scaling and need to learn it)
  - Postgres instead of sqlite3
  - Separate container for filesystem access to facilitate scaling up
  - ValKey (open source fork of Redis) for caching files
  - Nix instead of docker for development, possibly production as well
- But first I want to get this working completely for testing in beta so that I can share with a few select colleagues.
- Lots of changes since last entry. Today is a day to celebrate, as I finally got the whole thing working on my remote server. 3 containers running caddy, echo app, and marp respectively. Caddy is reverse proxy for echo and at {username}.course-manager.app caddy serves static sites.  It all works! I can't believe it! ðŸ¥³ðŸ˜­
- App is still registered as 'testing' not 'published' in google cloud console so I would need to add specific users until I publish it (authorized redirects cannot be http for published apps)
- Created unauthorized page and types and functions for responding to various unauthorized user scenarios
- Configured signin/signup route handlers to disallow non-cms gmail accounts
