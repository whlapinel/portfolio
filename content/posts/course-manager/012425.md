### 1/24/2025

Went a bit nuts today with the scale of changes.

Changed the filesystem to a nested one so that deleting a node (term, course, unit, lesson) will delete all of its children. For deleting things, I have a confirmation on the UI but maybe it's still a bit too easy to delete a lot of work, potentially forever!

Major change to static site in that I changed the directory names to match the server's new file structure so that I can simply copy the entire directory over once, including slides, images, and files, and then just render the pages. Vastly simpler than what I was doing before.

Removed images from DB, previously removed slides and files. So now a lot of things I had to register in the DB is simply housed within the node directory.
