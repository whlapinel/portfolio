- Added the files capability to units and courses in the same way that it's available in lessons.
- I am increasingly noticing there's a tremendous potential for consolidating code to accommodate CourseNode interface and replacing the particular functions and data for course, unit, lesson, etc...
- This could cut down the total lines by at least 50%, if not more, and could make it more maintainable. I am very trepidatious about it though because it could be a lot of work and would have to be done with great care.
