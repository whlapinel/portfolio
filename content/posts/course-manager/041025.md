Today I made an amazing accidental discovery. If html is wrapped in an iframe then the browser nav buttons like ðŸ”™ will work even though the URL isn't modified. This means I can essentially navigate between html-rendered markdown files while staying on the current page!

For example, in a lesson assignment's file I put a link to a unit project file. I was amazed to see the new file simply replace the previous file in the iframe. This will be extremely useful.

Brainstorming further: once I change things so that assignment instructions can be written as markdown and viewed as html rendered by goldmark, I can put that in an iframe and then link to other html-rendered markdownfiles as if it's an internal static site! ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²
