Progress has been a little slow due to other life events. Spent 2 weeks on Reserve annual training 13-26 April, plus getting self and family ready for it and recovering from it has been somewhat of a strain. There were a couple of periods lasting several days in which I didn't get a chance to touch the project. It's amazing how quickly you can lose the mental picture, even after such a short time. Everything looked completely foreign to me each time I had gone a few days without looking at it.

That said, I did manage to make some decent headway in rewriting the project. I questioned myself more than a few times on the merits of doing so but ultimately I think it was the right step to take.
