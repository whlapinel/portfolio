I've made a ton of additions/changes, just haven't been writing here lately.

I do want to mention that I spent several days exploring the possibility of using Hugo for site generation, but today I decided that having to use go templates vs. templ was not obviously  worth the benefits as far as I could see. Templ is just way, way easier to write UI with. The extra serialization required for using Hugo was also a major drag, having to pass data programmatically through markdown really did not seem worth it. A lot of my decision was just realizing the steepness of the learning curve involved. Templ is working just fine for me, and I just parallelized the site generation so that will help with the small performance concerns I had.
