Great progress on the web app. I've just about matched the feaures of the fyne app and about to surpass. Surprised at how easy it was to implement the Shift Lesson UI. Quality of everything is much better and I feel more confident in how everything is laid out. Having fun returning to web dev, and just absolutely love working with HTMX.

I happen to have made all my lesson names e.g. Lesson 1.2 but this is redundant info with the Lesson Number and Unit Number and makes the Name field/column pointless in my case.  A teacher would certainly to display the numbers, but they also might want a name for a lesson. I am thinking that perhaps I should display the lesson number but I should make the name separate, more like a name that briefly describes the topic or activity, less like the designation number. One problem is this would require fetching the unit number from the units table whenever I need to display a lesson, but that might not be such a pain if I just add it to the SQL queries.
