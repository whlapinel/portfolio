- Today I made a big change, assessment category is now a string instead of an integer. this meant doing a database migration and converting all ints to equivalent strings. I did my first go migration with goose, as up til now I had only done sql migrations. The conversion logic required more than I could do with sql alone.
- Important: migrations are now included in the deployment pipeline in the following way:
  - Migration is included in app image build (Dockerfile.echo)
  - In `task run-prod` migration is run as a separate container
