- Static site lesson details now uses tabs component to display slides, files, and assessments rather than trying to cram it all on one page. Looks great!
- Static site file viewer UI is looking great too, and the recursive part wasn't as bad as I expected!
- Realized I need to reorganize my project eventually to slice vertically according to features instead of horizontally according to layers. That seems to be the recommended approach nowadays compared with the older MVC approach. Of course this realization comes only after I have thoroughly entangled my features with each other according to layer (e.g. this monster NodeHandler interface)
- Pushed to remote in a matter of minutes and it works fantastic.
